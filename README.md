# filemanip
An NPM CLI that allows file manipulation. A lot of commands require ffmpeg to be pre-installed.

This is a very random, quick n' dirty (no unit tests) list of commands that I use to help friends and family organize media files. Any other use would be plesant but not anticipated.

## Requirements
* Node
* ffmpeg

## Installation
To install simply run

    npm install -g filemanip

## usage
To use filmanip cd into a directory of files you want manipulated and run ```filemanip command``` where 'command' is one of the commands below.

## Commands
* convert mp3          -- converts files into mp3 files

* meta randomplay      -- prepends `x_` in random order to filename and title, where 'x' is descending numbers
* meta addtracknumbers -- adds track numbers to files
